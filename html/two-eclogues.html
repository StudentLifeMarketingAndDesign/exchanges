                </p>
                <p>That was when not one soul <br />played the shepherd, Daphnis, <br />led the cows to cooling streams <br /> when not one animal
                    tasted river water <br />
                    or mouthed a blade of grass. </p>
                <p>
                    Daphnis, <br />
                    Barbary lions wept <br />your death <br />say the mountains,
                    say the wild beasts,<br />

                </p>
                <p>
                    Daphnis ordained how<br />
                    to harness Armenia’s tigers<br /> behind a chariot,<br />
                    Daphnis to dance<br />
                    under Bacchus’ grip,<br />
                    to weave whiplike weapons<br /> from tender leaves.

                    A grace<br />
                    to trees is the vine,<br />
                    to vineyards are grapes,<br />
                    to herds are bulls,<br />

                    After the Fates took you away, <br />Pales and Apollo forsook<br />
                    the fields, the furrows we trusted <br />seed barley grains to sprouted <br />hard luck darnel, infertile oats. <br />Tender petaled stocks,<br />

                    Come here, Galatea, what good<br />
                    to frolic in the waves? Spring time<br />
                    is brilliant, all around the rivers <br />earth pours flowers. A white poplar <br />overhangs the grotto and wisps<br />
                    of shadow woven of curling vines. <br />Come—let crazed waves pound sand.

                    Daphnis, why steal glances<br />
                    at the origins of age-old signs? <br />See, the star of Dione’s Caesar <br />is come forth, under this star <br />crops rejoice in their fruits and <br />grapes seep color into hills kissed <br />by the sun. Graft your pear trees, <br />Daphnis, may your grandsons <br />pick your apples own-grown.

                <p>Times takes away all, even the spirit. <br />Often in singing of that boy I recall<br />
                    I spent long days. Now forgotten are <br />so many of my songs, my own voice <br />runs away from me, Moeris; Moeris <br />yesterday’s wolves have seen. Menalcas <br />though can yet recite those verses<br />

                    Your pleadings have taken us deep<br />
                    into our love; now all the plain of the sea <br />is silent for you; see, all the breezes full<br />
                    of airy whirrs have ceased. From here on <br />our journey is at its midpoint for just <br />coming into view is Bianor’s tomb.<br /> Farmers are spreading out branches<br />
                    in swaths— here, Moeris, let us sing, <br />here let your goats go. Come what may, <br />we will come to the city. Or if we fear <br />the night may sooner unleash rain<br />
                    we might keep singing as we go,<br />
                    it makes the road less boring.<br />
                    Let’s go on and sing, I will lighten<br />
                    you of this load.
