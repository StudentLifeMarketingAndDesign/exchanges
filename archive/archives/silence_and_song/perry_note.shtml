<p>“Slow Waltz” was published first in 1966 in Akzente, a prominent German literary magazine, and in 1968 in the collection Geschichten (Stories), all under the pseudonym Artur Knoff. The blurb for that book declared that Knoff “gives no answers, rather he defers them, in order to reach ones more exact. His interest lies in the minute movement of thought.” </p> 
<p>Indeed, “Slow Waltz” is, as its narrator makes clear from the outset, less about the inherently dramatic bombings by left-wing terrorists or the “Dance School Trial” than it is about the narrator’s need to locate himself as an actor in the somewhat obscure chain of events that lead to up to them. This situation is a realistic representation of the political unrest in Germany following its division (the conservative Springer Press was a favorite target of leftist protesters in the late 1960s; one of its offices was bombed in Hamburg in 1968), but it also seems to echo the challenge particular to German citizens, following the second World War, to understand how they (as both individuals and “cogs”) fit into the machine of Nazism. To that end, Grass often uses language and imagery suggestive of automatism as well as militarism. The narrator’s tone, wandering as it does between self-flagellation and self-pardon, also speaks to this question. I have tried to render the English version in such a way as to preserve those echoes. </p>
