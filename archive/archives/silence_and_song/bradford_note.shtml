<p>Guillermo Boido (Buenos Aires, 1941) published four slim but warmly received books of poetry in the 1970s and, after what threatened to be a permanent silence, recently brought out a collection of new and selected work entitled La oscuridad del alba. Poemas 1970-2000. His new poems maintain the tersely phrased musing of his previous work, which established him as an essential voice of the ’70s. Boido’s generation of poets forms an interlude between the social commentary favored by the poets of the ’60s and the “neo-barroco” that dominated the poetry of the ’90s. Relying heavily on traditional Spanish poetics and decorum, these poets have often been criticized for their metapoetic bent and “fuzzy ideology.” Though Boido expressly denies that poetry should be political, one can’t help noticing the many references to siege, singing, naming, terror, forgetting, silence, solitude and other tropes that call to mind the dictatorship and “Dirty War” that raged during the time he was first writing.  These allusions may contribute to a metapoetic or even a metaphysical argument in the poems, but they often suggest scenes of terror, particularly in light of their social context. Therefore, the translation of this verse must maintain this interpretative hesitancy. </p>

<p>Boido’s poetry is challenging to translate because of its precisely balanced verse and this hesitancy it often provokes. For example, he has a fondness for using the word “olvido,” which is difficult to convey in English, for in different contexts it can mean “forgetting” or “oblivion,” and often proves rather abstract or awkward in English. Moreover, as this term can relate to the private memories of childhood or love as well as to the testimonials of the public sphere, it becomes one of the elements of this vacillating angle and so demands special care in its translation.  In “Habits,” for example, “forgetting” worked better than “oblivion,” but it was necessary to add a noun to save the line from utter abstraction: “love is a bird that / builds its nest on a forgotten past […]” thereby making for a more attractive conceit.</p>

<p>In this same poem, the melodic mirroring of “canta” and “calla” (it sings/ it hushes) is also problematic for the translator, since the English words cannot recreate a corresponding assonance. Furthermore, Boido’s poems are often built on a rhetoric of balanced equations—perhaps deriving from the poet’s education in mathematics—and thus require a similar juxtaposed logic. Here the parallelism is achieved with directional actions—rise and fall—which emphasize both the bird imagery and the polarity of song and silence.  However, the exact repetition of “olvido” has been sacrificed:</p>

<blockquote>love is a bird <br />
  that
builds its nest on a <em>forgotten past</em> <br />
and<br />
<em>rises into song</em> </blockquote>

<blockquote><em>forgetting</em> is a bird
 that	<br />
builds its nest in love and<br />
<em>falls into silence</em></blockquote>


<p>The wavering between the metapoetic and the euphemistic that is produced in much of Boido’s work is present in several of the poems in this selection.  In the poem “Craft,” the notion of silence is implied by the phrase “transparente de palabras,” (linguistically see-through) which I rendered as “wordbare” to play off the idea of speech as fabric and thus bring the metapoetic aspect of the poem into relief. In another poem, however, we find this hesitancy pushing the poem to work in two simultaneous directions, rather like an optical illusion between the terror of the clandestine jails and a metaphysical meditation on loneliness: </p>

<blockquote>Someone sings on a distant shore.
Someone lights a fire.</blockquote>

<blockquote>We dance.  This castaway's grimace
looks like a greeting.  We dance.<br />
(“4”) </blockquote>


<p>As culturally implicit meanings prove so difficult to carry over to different linguistic contexts without some prefatory statement, we can only leave the door open for those possible connotations to enter. These translations of Boido’s work offer an array of this “castaway’s” voice and its hesitancy while providing fine examples of his delicate equilibrium and meditation. </p>
