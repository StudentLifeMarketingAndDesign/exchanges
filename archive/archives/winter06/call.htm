The International Writing Program at the University of Iowa is currently designing a course which would give English-speaking students a glimpse of how "America" is being spoken about, hinted at, alluded to, in contemporary world fiction, poetry and creative non-fiction.  We would like to assemble and continuously expand  a curriculum of recent pieces or literaryfragments  that would be translated by translators outside the UI, or forwarded to us to be translated by students in the UI MFA translation program, used as course readings and then published annually as a special issue of the IWP's on-line journal 91st Meridian.For suggestions, inquiries, and submissions, please contact --><OBJECT classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000"
