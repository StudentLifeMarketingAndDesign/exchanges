Recently, her street installations of poetry were featured in the catalogue <em>Down the Corner and Around the Street</em> by New Museum curator Melanie Franklin Cohn.

<h2>Jean-Joseph Rabearivelo</h2>
<p><img src="images/rabearivelo.jpg" width="100" height="120" />Jean-Joseph Rabearivelo was born Joseph-Casimir in Antananarivo, Madagascar in 1901. Both within and beyond Madagascar, Rabearivelo is generally considered the country’s greatest poet. His many admirers have included Jean-Paul Sartre, Leopold Senghor, and Jean Paulhan. By the time of his tragic death at 36, Rabearivelo had produced six books of poems in French, nearly all of which he had translated into Malagasy; published his critical and poetic work both at home and in Europe; served as editor of two French literary journals in Madagascar; and developed many literary correspondents all over the world. Rabearivelo’s other works include two novels, several plays, a number of critical essays, a number of poems in Spanish, and many translations between French and Malagasy. Much of his work still has not been translated into English; some of it has been mistranslated, or translated but not identified as originally written in French. Rabearivelo worked tirelessly to promote Malagasy literature and resisted the French government’s prohibition against writing in the Malagasy language. He was in love with two literatures, each of which he tried to embody and further in his work: the rich oral and written tradition of Madagascar, with its highly complex forms; and French Symbolist and post-Symbolist poetry. In his last three volumes of poetry, Rabearivelo was able to find a balance among these elements, producing what are generally considered to be his most mature and original works. Sadly, Rabearivelo did not realize his lifelong hope to visit France. For many years the French colonial government prohibited him from leaving his island; then, in 1937, they refused to grant him a visa to travel to Paris and represent Madagascar at the Exposition Universelle, sending a group of basket weavers instead. Feeling trapped, exhausted by the low-paying jobs that represented the only means available in colonial Madagascar for supporting his family, despairing at the sudden death of his three-year-old daughter Voahangy, and disheartened by a growing addiction to opium, Rabearivelo committed suicide in 1937.</p>
