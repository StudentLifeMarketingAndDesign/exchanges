  <p>The selections presented here were published in Jean-Joseph Rabearivelo’s late collections <em>Presque-songes</em> [<em>Almost Dreams</em>, 1934] and <em>Traduit de la nuit</em> [<em>Translated from the Night</em>, 1935].  Short-lived, slippery referents abound in these volumes: trees filled with &ldquo;vegetable blood,” &ldquo;a land with no color and no climate,” birds that have no body or peck clouds, a forest that is also the act of reading, a kind of person-tree, and a narrator who appears, for all intents and purposes, to be mud.  Rabearivelo’s love of Ovid’s <em>Metamorphoses</em> and Malagasy folklore is everywhere apparent, especially as embodied by the bird and tree figures that recur in the poems. As the phrase &ldquo;translated from the night” implies, these poems evoke a liminal space—a zone between night and day, between French and Malagasy forms, between concreteness and abstraction. And in the process, as Ulli Baer writes, Jean-Joseph Rabearivelo’s works &ldquo;destroy reality, building out of its fragments a new mythical world” (quoted in <em>The Negritude Poets</em>). This gesture is a defining feature of the poet’s mature work, where precise and vivid natural imagery is often momentarily deployed, only to be uprooted by a series of shifting images, metaphors, or registers.  The mixing occurs at the level of genre too: in his late work Rabearivelo marries features of the Malagasy <em>hain-teny</em>—a spoken form, Zen-like but highly structured, that delivers swiftly turning love-debates glittering with polemic and absurdity—to the French literary elements he loved throughout his life.  These include Symbolist and post-Symbolist poetry, free verse, and the prose poem.  Although Rabearivelo eventually went so far as to combine the <em>hain-teny</em> directly with the prose poem in his last collection, traces of  the Malagasy form also appear in the gaps and quick turns of many of his other late works.</p>
  <p>The result of all this interleaving is a texture of strange images and diction, one that challenges the translator to attend closely to precise meanings, but also to &ldquo;translate” any gaps or ambiguities wholesale.  In the first instance, the task is to find apt English equivalents but avoid imposing a sound of translatedness where none was foregrounded in the original.  This matters most in poems where Rabearivelo evokes a sense of mystery primarily by describing or positing it, rather than by propagating its effects within the language of the poem itself.  In &ldquo;The Three Birds,” for example, I tried to convey the three figures clearly while at the same time approximating, as far as possible, the poem’s subtle overarching assonance and the stanza form with its mix of mostly two-, three- and four-stress lines.  Highlights included translating &ldquo;<em>tombe en même temps que le soir</em>” as &ldquo;falls in tandem with the night” (Stanza 2, line 11), in hopes of rendering the striking image of a bird falling as the night falls (this last phrasing being an alternative translation).  In English, the latter, perhaps more lyrical, wording would introduce a pleasing sound that’s lacking in the original.  It also reads like a ready-made cliché in English.  So I chose a clear translation of the image over superfluous felicity. </p>
  <p>But in &ldquo;Read” and &ldquo;You There” the very texture of the poetry itself, with its subtle disruptions and aporias, constantly requires the translator to resist smoothing out odd or jarring phrases or juxtapositions.  Interestingly, smoothness and consistency belong to the earlier period of Rabearivelo’s work, in which (as he later believed) he had been fixated on strict metrical forms (brilliantly employed in some cases) and sometimes slavishly imitated the French Parnassians.  Rabearivelo’s decision to take a different direction in his later work is important, and I wanted to try to respect it.  For example, the narrator of &ldquo;You There,” whose manner of addressing the &ldquo;you” of the poem is eerily, intrusively directive, begins with the startling but simply stated:</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You there<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;standing naked!</p>
  <p>After alerting the addressee that &ldquo;you are mud and remember it,” the speaker abruptly shifts registers, using three words that have more of a 20th-century, techno-scientific, processed feel: &ldquo;<em>parturiante</em>” and &ldquo;<em>lactogen lunaire</em>.”  I feel this kind of shift is what gives the poem its paradoxical sense of groundlessness, so I wanted to preserve it.  But I struggled with the use of the English cognate &ldquo;parturient,” repeatedly deleting it because it fitfully <em>sounded</em> like a bad translation, then finally retaining it because its etymological echoes of splitting and parting seem so apt and beautiful.  With &ldquo;<em>lactogen lunaire</em>”, though—literally, &ldquo;lunar lactogen”—I tried to convey the processed feel semantically rather than through register, because it seemed important to avoid over-inflecting the poem with a taste of translatedness.  Luckily, alliteration stayed: </p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually you’re the child of this parturient dark<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who feeds on the milkstuff of the moon.... </p>
  <p>If &ldquo;You There” subtly destabilizes the reader, &ldquo;Read” uproots the illusion of readerly and writerly stability altogether.  It’s a deceptively spare poem and, when slowed down in the process of translation, has an uncanniness that seems to belie any sunny symbol-making.  In fact, the text’s disruptions of reference, grammar, and syntax are a fascinating window into Rabearivelo’s late work.  These disruptions also seem inextricable from the act of translating an &ldquo;other” language.  As a translator, I’m often troubled by questions, whether through ignorance, acuity, or sheer difference of mind, that might fly under the radar of a &ldquo;native” speaker.  Translation made the poem &ldquo;Read” never end, and in the rest of this note I want to try to dip down into that experience.</p>
  <p>The title of the poem feels  more like a tease than a topic.  &ldquo;<em>Lire</em>” can be translated as an imperative, an infinitive, or a gerund; as such, it’s a coda of the poem not so much in a titular as in a transactional, reader-response sense. &ldquo;<em>Lire</em>” as a title makes me wonder things like: Do you mean to command me to &ldquo;read,” or do you want to invoke the abstract process of all &ldquo;reading”? If &ldquo;<em>Lire</em>” is used in the imperative sense, this command seems cold and distant: the French infinitive has long figured imperatively  in manuals and recipes and the like—contexts in which no one bothers to posit a more personal &ldquo;you.”  So &ldquo;<em>Lire</em>” can feel as distant and directive as the voice of a colonial functionary. In the end, I translated it as &ldquo;Read” because the slight ambiguity in English can have the same destabilizing effect (is it a noun or imperative?).  &ldquo;Reading,” which I worried was unduly sweeping as a title, and &ldquo;To Read,” which could smack of histrionic proclamation, seemed to tamp down the indeterminacy. But turning down &ldquo;To Read” is also a loss: a beauty of infinitives is that they strip away inflection—no person, tense, mood, or aspect. (To compensate, I added an extra infinitive in Stanza 4.) </p>
  <p>In fact, the title &ldquo;<em>Lire</em>” is the tip of the iceberg.   The poem itself is a bundle of locutions that start out tamely but hatch into unanticipated accretions, proliferations, or truncations. At times Rabearivelo seems to be rehearsing different ways of simultaneously commanding, effacing, and author-izing &ldquo;You.” &ldquo;You” (understood) are exhorted at every turn to complete the poem—actively to fill its gaps and parse its staccato fits and starts. The you-less title &ldquo;Read” is followed by two instances of the imperative (&ldquo;Not a sound, don’t speak”).  With &ldquo;Not a sound” I tried to carry you-lessness over the top by removing even the verb.  This phrase seemed fitting because it opens the poem with a statement that could be either a command to the reader or a description of a noiseless place.  It also raises the question that returns in Stanzas 3 and 4: what kind of &ldquo;Not a sound” is this exactly?  Then there’s the peculiarly inverted line 2, which translates literally as &ldquo;they go to explore a forest, [do] the eyes, courage…etc.” To preserve this syntactic order-effect, I tried anacoluthon, a rhetorical figure that starts a new syntax mid-sentence. I like the fact that anacoluthon is common in spoken language and can figure either as a device or a mistake.  It seemed fitting here because the disruptions and repetitions of the poem kept reminding me of spoken language—like Mamet crossed with a skippily sampled simple song.</p>
  <p>But a bigger challenge comes when the poem nears Stanza 4.   Stanza 3’s &ldquo;Forest rustling with silence,” the second in a series of verbless, article-free noun phrases, contains a bird that becomes the spin-off point for further evasive infinitives, the culmination of which appears in Stanza 4:</p>
  <p><em>&Agrave; qui l’on fera chanter, à qui l’on fera pleurer<br />
    </em></p>
  <blockquote style="margin-top:-10px;"><em>le lieu de son éclosion.</em></blockquote>
  <p>Who to make it sing to, who to make it cry to<br />
  </p>
  <blockquote style="margin-top:-10px;">for the place where it hatched.</blockquote>
  <p>In translating, I tried to ratchet up the infinitive (casting even &ldquo;make” into that mode) and hoped the English would feel duly slippery with the awkward &ldquo;to/for” and the four &ldquo;to’s.” The last of these bears the poem’s familiar stamp of surprising the reader by shifting into an unexpected grammatical construction.  That is, the verb &ldquo;<em>fera pleurer</em>”—&ldquo;make cry”—at first seems complete, echoing the identical phrase used <em>in</em>transitively in  Stanza 3.  But after the line break we suddenly meet the apparent object of &ldquo;<em>pleurer</em>”: &ldquo;<em>le lieu de son éclosion</em>,” or &ldquo;the place where it hatched.” Luckily, &ldquo;cry to/for” offered a roughly equivalent lurch in English. A further end-surprise here is the withholding of the question-mark, another grammatical element foreclosed, the right-wrong feel of which I hope has a shot at coming through in English.</p>
  <p>So the bird to trap got away. The bird to make cry.  For the place where it hatched.  But who to make it sing to, who is making the bird sing, and who is making the bird up?  In one sense the narrator/writer catches, forces, &ldquo;makes” both the poem and the reader/translator—but in another sense we all, in turn, make up the text and him (as I do here?).  The bird is hidden, but hidden as an open book or source, in &ldquo;your” hands.  Maybe, as Wolfgang Iser says, &ldquo;the significance of the work…does not lie in the meaning sealed within the text, but in the fact that the meaning brings out what had been previously sealed within us…[W]e actually participate in the text, and this means that we are caught up in the very thing we are producing” (<em>The Act of Reading</em>).  Writing, reading, and translation are sideways-flits of blooming, scheming, hatching—&ldquo;<em>son éclosion</em>” (literally, &ldquo;his hatching”) flickers in French with all these meanings and offers, to boot, the Latin root <em>e-claudere</em>, meaning, paradoxically, to close out. The place of his hatching (to translate slightly differently).  Reading is no place really and is infinitely pronominal, even if it flits by as a forest at a poem’s opening.  Or it’s a forest offering unpredictable processes of arising, slithering, decomposition. </p>
  <p>Maybe to hatch is to be programmed helplessly to emerge (like a language) from a husk, but to hatch is also to scheme.  Like so much in the translation of this poem, hatching seems to enact the paradoxical split of &ldquo;parturience” hinted at in &ldquo;You There.”  Here, the book-bird &ldquo;in your hands” at the end of the poem is pared, split between receiving and creating a text.  The split is there in the phrase &ldquo;rustling with silence”: in language things can be parsed out of their opposites.  Another way to translate &ldquo;<em>bruissant de silence</em>” is &ldquo;humming with stillness.” Clearly, to try to read or translate something is to find that even the meaning you do catch escapes, whether through form or content, through the active joy of making something up or the fallen, imperfect pleasure of trying to follow what’s &ldquo;actually there.” Though, if you believe the Modernist painter Morandi, nothing is more abstract than reality.  And even a beginner’s mind can make something up that’s true: the first time I opened the book to &ldquo;<em>Lire</em>” and my eye jumped to &ldquo;<em>son éclosion</em>,” I thought &ldquo;Sound hatching!”  &ldquo;<em>Son</em>” does mean &ldquo;sound” in French, but arguably only someone darting between two languages would see a flicker of &ldquo;sound” in a word that, to more habituated readers, would reflexively mean &ldquo;her” or &ldquo;his” (which it does mean, here, mostly) in context.  But maybe &ldquo;<em>son</em>,” sound, is the &ldquo;Not-a-sound,” the something &ldquo;rustling with silence,” that Rabearivelo had in mind. </p>
  <p>In translation, everything 
&ldquo;keeps never coming,” as James Merrill says in his poem about waiting as a child, over a lonely summer on Long Island (another island), for a mail-order puzzle.  He writes:</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;…[N]othing’s lost.  Or else: all is translation<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And every bit of us is lost in it…<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in that loss a self-effacing tree,<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Color of context, imperceptibly<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rustling with its angel, turns the waste<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To shade and fiber, milk and memory.<br />
    <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Lost in Translation,” ll. 227-232</p>
  <p>Elsewhere in Merrill’s poem, the narrator comes to know the objects of the world by being told their names in more than one language.  Rabearivelo knew this translator’s two-step like the back of his hand, and that fact seems to figure on many levels in his poems. His &ldquo;first” language was Malagasy, but French was his second first language from an early age.  As part of his composing process, Rabearivelo translated nearly all of his works from French into the Malagasy language, also known as Hova. After letting readers assume initially that the process ran in the other direction (who knows why?), Rabearivelo wrote in a letter to a friend just before his death: &ldquo;I think it is now time to confess a secret: none of my books was written directly in Hova; all of them were written in French.”  So the Malagasy poet lived intimately with the peculiar jangling of signifiers that comes with the process of translation. He was a consummate importer-exporter of otherness, even if he never got to leave Madagascar.  As Leopold Senghor said in his 1961 address to L’Académie Malagache: &ldquo;In the exercise of his art, Rabearivelo used foreign elements... as one might use a dictionary.  He adapted to the Malagasy land—to its soul—ideas and words that came from elsewhere.  It is he who created the new Malagasy poetry, whether or not its language is French.”</p>
