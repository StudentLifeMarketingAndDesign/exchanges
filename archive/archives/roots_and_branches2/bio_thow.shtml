<p>Amelia Rosselli (1930-1996) was one of the most important experimental Italian poets of the twentieth century. First trained as a composer and musicologist, she turned to writing in her early twenties. Her books include <em>Variazione Belliche</em> (1964), which has been translated by Lucia Re and Paul Vangelisti as War Variations (Green Integer, 2005), <em>Serie Ospedaliera</em> (1969), <em>Documento</em> (1976), <em>Impromptu</em> (1981), and <em>Frammenti sparsi e persi </em>(1983). In addition to her Italian verse, she published a collection of her English poetry, <em>Sleep-Sonno</em> (trans. Antonio Porta, 1989; trans. Emmanuela Tandello, 1992). She also worked as a literary translator, translating the poetry of Sylvia Plath and Emily Dickinson, among others. Her essays were collected posthumously in <em>Una Scrittura Plurale</em> (2004). Her collected poems, edited by Emmanuela Tandello, were published by Garzanti in 1997, and another edition of her collected works is forthcoming with Mondadori in 2010.</p>
