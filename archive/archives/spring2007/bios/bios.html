His fame in Argentina is largely due to the relationship he had with J. L. Borges, acting as the younger man’s mentor and sage during the 1920s, when Buenos Aires had an active avant garde literary scene. Macedonio (as he is known) composed hilarious toasts for foreign visitors such as Marinetti; he presided at the café La Perla over what was called the “oral journal,” the “revista oral”—wicked nights of speechifying, nonsense, and sound poetry.&nbsp; Much older than his colleagues, Macedonio was recently widowed and had given up his law practice in favor of the literary life.&nbsp; In his eulogy, Borges said that he admired Macedonio “to the point of plagiarism.”&nbsp; Those who know Borges can find Macedonio references in “El testigo” and “Diálogo sobre un diálogo”<em>, </em>both in <em>El Hacedor.&nbsp; </em>None of the essays published here have been translated into English before now—indeed, nothing has been translated aside from an out-of-print collection of excerpts from his ten-volume <em>Complete Works</em>.<br />
               <em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>However prolific his written production, however, very little of it made its way into print during his lifetime.&nbsp; This failure to publish has led many to presume, as Borges asserted, that his best words were lost to the air: that his true art was conversation, not composition.&nbsp; Macedonio’s written style is indeed very cryptic, but he is also a great humorist—especially in the few pieces he wrote for publication.&nbsp; The pieces I’ve translated here are part of a collection of sketches and essays from the 1920s published in avant-garde literary journals such as <em>Proa </em>and <em>Martín Fierro.</em>&nbsp; These were later assembled, along with notes for his toasts and for the “oral journal,” under the name <em>Papeles del Recienvenido</em> (<em>The Newcomer’s Papers</em>) and published in 1929.<br />
               The essays in <em>The Newcomer’s Papers</em> describe the absurd adventures of the Newcomer as he discovers Buenos Aires, often comment upon his status of “newcomer” to literature, and tell stories of the absurdity of life among the lawyers.&nbsp;&nbsp; Through his alter ego, Macedonio combines high satire with hilarious absurdity as his eternally surprised but easily irritated Newcomer alternately learns from and lectures his public on proper conduct for accident victims and their onlookers, strategies for recovering lost buttons and celebrating birthdays.&nbsp; <br />
              This open relationship with the reader carries over into my translation strategy.&nbsp; I’ve often taken a holistic approach, altering punctuation and syntax in order to capture voice and tone.&nbsp; I can’t say whether I’ve “improved” or “corrected” his work, but I hope something of the original I’ve left behind delights you as it does me.</p>

             <p align="center"><strong>The Sweet and Sour Love Songs of Zi Ye.&nbsp; </strong></p>
             <p>At some time in the fourth century CE, a collection of 117 erotic quatrains appeared in a publication by the <em>Yue Fu</em>, or Music Bureau, an institution founded by the great Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty which continued to flourish for centuries thereafter. These particular poems are known as the 子 夜 歌, <em>(Zi Ye Ge)</em> or <em>Songs of the Person of the Night</em>. But who was this Zi Ye who, from the evidence of the songs themselves, appeared to be a courtesan or wine-shop girl? Her passions are vividly and memorably expressed in these tiny songs, but there is no external evidence of her existence beyond the songs themselves. Was she the author or the subject? Was she a real person or the figment of someone’s imagination? There is continued debate among scholars and commentators about this; some argue that the overall consistency of the poetry is evidence for a single author. Others point to the strong later tradition of collective contributions by scholar-poets to genres such as the&nbsp; 詞 (<em>ci)</em> which frequently employ a female persona, and so conclude that Zi Ye may be simply a genre title. Nevertheless, the strength of her personality guarantees her reality as a powerful presence; I certainly believed in her when translating these poems, and I think it will be easy for readers to believe in her also and to recognize the experiences and feelings portrayed in the poems as familiar and truthful.</p>
             <p>The songs are in the form of single regular quatrains with five characters per line. A rhyming scheme of A-B-C-B is almost ubiquitous, giving them an epigrammatic quality which I have tried to reproduce in my translations. I have used rhyme or half-rhyme where I could do so without compromising the meaning; where I could not, I have left them unrhymed. I have used the colloquial language of our own time, in the conviction that there is no archaic speech form that would bring the reader any closer to the originals.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
             <p>It is often remarked that China has no strong tradition of erotic poetry; I hope that familiarity with these songs, which had a powerful influence on so much poetry that came later, will help to dispel that false assumption.</p>
