         <h2>Cussen Translator’s note</h2>
         <p>I started this translation without the author's permission. While taking a translation course with Richard Howard at Columbia University, I turned my attention to the poetry book my father had published in Chile in 2001. With Richard Howard, I worked closely on translating the first five pages. The hardest part in my original English drafts was finding the combination of passion and precision that I loved in the original. With Richard's help and enthusiasm, we eventually found a similar tone. Only after finishing the first five pages did I show my father my first translation. He was caught off-guard, especially because I was supposed to be concentrating on my own fiction writing in my M.F.A. program. After a slight hesitation, he encouraged me to finish. Many of the choices I made involved discarding options that we later admitted we had both thought of individually. His suggestions for this final translation were far fewer than I had expected; he only had two—and one of those changes was a comma. Perhaps fathers and sons do think alike.</p>
         <p>This poetry book has also been well received by other Latin American writers. On October 27, 2002, Roberto Bolaño wrote the following email to my father in response to having read Mecenas. This was less than a year before the Chilean-born writer died:<br />
  &quot;I can't remember reading with so much interest, in recent times, a book by any other 	Chilean poet. The well-chosen, precise metaphors and the sustained rhythm that sinks 	little by little into despair… A great poem, against all prevailing tides.&quot;</p>
