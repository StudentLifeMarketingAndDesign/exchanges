<!--ContributorsMICHAEL FARMAN is an electronics engineer now living in Texas where he works under contract to NASA. Many years ago his studies, at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London, later in Hong Kong, stimulated a lifelong interest in Chinese culture, but he began translating the classical poetry only about four years ago. His translations have since appeared in a number of  literary magazines and twelve will be featured in the Renditions anthology "A Silver Treasury of Chinese Lyrics" to be published in October this year. His first book "Clouds and WANG WEI was born in 699 in  P'u-chou, China, into a family that had yielded 13 prime ministers of the T'ang court. By the age of 15, he was a skillful poet and musician and in 717, he won first place in the metropolitan examination in preparation for a government career. . He is considered the first master of atmosphere and the founder of Southern Chinese landscape art. After many years of service at court, he retired to a Buddhist monastery after the death of his wife and mother in the same year. Wang Wei died in 759.Rain, Lyrics of Love and Desire from Medieval China" will be published early next year.        ZHANG FANGSHENG lived in the Sixteen  Dynasties period of China, in about 400 AD. This       makes him a near-contemporary with the more famous Tao Qian but little is known about him       to this day.                                                           .--><OBJECT classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000"
