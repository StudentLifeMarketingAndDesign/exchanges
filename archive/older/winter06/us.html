<!--NICKY AGATE is an Irish transplant. Before becoming a translatrix-in-training at the University of Iowa, she was (in no particular order) a travel journalist, a music and film critic, a  nude model, a dog sitter, a columnist and a chicken frier. She has lived in New York City, Belfast, Glasgow, Paris and Australia but has settled, for now, in fairest Iowa. She officially translates the literature of France and Spain, but spends most of her time being distracted by two cats, a charming gentleman, and the thought of having a dog someday.TEGAN RALEIGH is a product of Silicon Valley, and, after having spent several years rebelling against her fiberoptic roots, now whiles away the hours writing, reading, translating, and wasting time on her laptop.  She has lived in Oregon, France, Sumatra, and, most recently, Iowa City, but was born to live in 19th century Paris or 1960's San Francisco.  What with mornings of working out to Sweatin' to the Oldies 3, lunchtimes of grading rhetoric papers, and evenings spent dancing with her cat, she considers herself to have a true renaissance style. JAMIE RICHARDS has spent her life on her biography. In brief: a childhood of pilfering books, an adolescence fraught with normality, and a college experience filled with toil and trouble. Somehow these things led to a graduate career at the University of Iowa, where she is an exchange student from California grappling with the theoretical implications of Midwesternity. She haphazardly resides with two charming young felines named Carmen and Fellini, and sometimes indulges her overwhelming urges to translate Italian. --><OBJECT classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000"
