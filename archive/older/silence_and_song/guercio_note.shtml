<p>Ears of the Wolf is the story of a Colombian childhood told in sixteen chapters/episodes, divided between "Dark Days," and "Light Days."  Woven together, they follow our narrator from early childhood (the book opens on his third birthday party) in the foothills near Bogota, to treacherous schoolyards, mountaintop lakes, forbidding blocks in the dreaded "city of cold," Colombia's wild eastern plains, and the deepest jungles of Panama.</p>

<p>Our nameless narrator is an intuitive, emotional young boy with no friends, but a great deal of imagination.  A loner, he is engulfed by the magic of his mountainous countryside, certain that he can turn at will into the tiger that lives inside him, and that his sister is really a small cat.  The family is broken up when the boy's father becomes a "ghost" (having left or been kicked out), and the unfortunate man's specter haunts the rest of the piece, hanging darkly over the narrator, his adored little sister, and his beloved young mother. Struggling with money, the three make a series of moves, splitting up, exposing themselves to abuse at the hands of relatives and harsh city life, but always coming back together as they attempt to forge a stable future.</p>

<p>Antonio Ungar tells Ears of the Wolf in an unusual first person present.  Insistent, urgent, this choice results in a narrator perpetually in the moment - and ahead of himself.  The narrator's diction and insight often exceed what one supposes to be age-appropriate limits, swinging between wisdom and innocence.  In this, I find a celebration of the richness that lies in any individual's consciousness, and particularly in the special consciousness of this odd and engaging little boy.  It is this voice, its intensity and strangeness, which I've most sought to capture in my translation, the way in which his character deepens and adapts over time but never relinquishes his imaginative power or unique worldview.</p>
