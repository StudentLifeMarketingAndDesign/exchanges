<p>
When translating a poet who wrote nearly a hundred years ago, I make an effort to consult multiple sources, both primary and secondary, to build a picture of the poet and her work as well as of the literary context of the time. Juana de Ibarbourou wrote with a demand for serious artistic respect. In her work as a whole, acts of speaking are assertions of women's basic right to claim a position as artist, as writer. In my translations, I try to make that assertion resonate and expand through the interconnections of the poem's words, creating a meaning in the realm of metaphor: to make it clear, for example, that de Ibarbourou is not just writing about a grove of trees in the wind, but is also representing the tension between poetry and silence through the trees’ voice. To echo the shape of her poem, I have emphasized the grove of trees as both anthropomorphic and feminine, as “she” and in opposition to “los hombres” at the poem's close as “men,” not humanity. Gendering the representation of the inarticulate, the inexpressible, in this poem, is a political choice I have made as a translator.</p>
