      <p><span class="style4"><strong>Becka  Mara McKay</strong> (left) is fairly certain she has been  in graduate school for more than 100 years. She earned an MFA in translation  from the University of Iowa and an MFA in creative writing from the University  of Washington, and is currently working on her PhD in comparative literature. She  tries to leave Iowa whenever possible, and as a result has visited Morocco,  Bangladesh, and Israel in the last year. She translates poetry and fiction from  modern Hebrew, and her work can be found in <em>ACM</em>, <em>American Letters &amp; Commentary</em>, <em>Columbia</em>, <em>Controlled  Burn</em>, <em>Cranky</em>, <em>Hayden’s Ferry Review</em>, <em>Third Coast</em>, and <em>TWO  LINES</em>. In 2004 she received a fellowship  from the American Literary Translators Association. </span></p>
      <p class="style4"><strong>Emily Weirich</strong> (right) has had a dictionary somewhere on her person since  she bought a copy of <em>Fleurs de Mal </em>(yes, she was 14) at a  second-hand bookshop in her hometown of Lansing, Michigan. Since then, the  added weight hasn’t been able to hold her down, and she’s made her home in  Amboise (France), Ann Arbor, Beijing, Shanghai, New York, and now Iowa City.  She’s currently translating the poetry of the 12th-century Chinese  poet Zhu Shuzhen, for which she needs many, many, many dictionaries. </p>
