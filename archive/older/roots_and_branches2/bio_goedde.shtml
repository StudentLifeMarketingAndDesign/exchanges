<h2>Emily Goedde</h2>
<p>Emily Goedde received her M.F.A. in Translation from the University of Iowa. Her thesis was entitled <em>Heartbreak: The Poems of Zhu Shuzhen</em>. While at Iowa, she served as co-editor of <em>eXchanges</em>. Her work has appeared in <em>91st Meridian</em> and is forthcoming in <em>The Iowa Review</em>.</p>

<h2>Zhu Shuzhen</h2>
<p><img src="images/shuzen.jpg" align="right" style="padding-left:4px; padding-right: 5px; display: block;" />Zhu Shuzhen (朱淑真) has long been considered one of the most important female poets of pre-modern China, and her collected body of work, <em>Heartbreak</em> (<em>Duanchang shiji</em> <em>斷腸詩集</em>), consists of over 300 poems. Because all the information we have about Zhu Shuzhen is found either in the poems themselves or in a short preface to the first edition of <em>Heartbreak</em>, scholars dispute even the most basic details of her life. Some believe she lived from 1063 to 1106. Others doubt she lived at all. Some suggest that the collection was written in part by a woman, in part by men. Some suggest it was written entirely by a man or a group of men. </p>
<p>Although we cannot definitvely prove that a woman wrote these poems, we also need not default to male authorship. Having spent two years translating <em>Heartbreak</em>, I would argue that the unity of voice in the majority of the work, joined with the fact that the poems are not allegorical, voyeristic, or eroticized, suggests that there was indeed a poet, Zhu Shuzhen. The details of her life are lost to history. How lucky we are that her poems survived.</p>
