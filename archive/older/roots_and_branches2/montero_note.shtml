  <p>Argentine poet María Negroni’s <em>Go</em> (<em>Andanza</em>; Pretextos, 2009) explores the dynamics of an intimate combat, an amorous and ruminative dance with fatality and loss. The trope is the tango, a dance form rooted in rootlessness, developed by immigrant <em>porteños</em> at the turn of the 20th century in Argentina. Although the book explicitly mentions the tango just once (“don’t mistake me, this is not a tango”), the negated metaphor emerges unequivocally in the mood, form, language, and “philosophical foreplay” of the poems. True to its form, the poems address the tango with a no that means yes.</p>
  <p>Negation as affirmation amounts to an intimate address to a lost lover, country, and past. Situated between an I and you, the reader stands in the erotic crossfire of lovers, of love and loss, of then and never-again, of there (Argentina) and here (New York). The poems flirt with memory, as with an impending never, to ultimately affirm a feeling of here, now, and being. As a pull in two directions, the dance simulates a kind of moving on.</p>
  <p>It is simple, maybe unavoidable, to apply this trope to the translation. The translation is born out of an acute sense of its foreignness and inevitable loss. It is pulled between past and present, then and now. It tosses and wavers amorously in its own ruminative dance. The choreography of the translation is just as much an enactment of desire (the root of tango is <em>tangere</em>, to touch), otherness, and fatality as the tango itself, and just as much a choreography destabilized by improvisation and response. </p>
  <p>One challenge is the Buenos Aires dialect, insofar as it unequivocally places the poems and lends a dynamic tonal play, a constant back and forth of registers. I attempt to stage a parallel dialogue of registers - not clashing, but intimately at odds. </p>
  <p>Another challenge in translation is the syntax. Spanish word order is more flexible and can shift and swerve more gracefully than English. Each of these poems is a “winding body,” and I was careful not to straighten them out; I embraced inversions where I could. </p>
