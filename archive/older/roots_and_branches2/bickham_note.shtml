  <p>Upon my initial reading of Julia Franck’s short story “Crumb Cake,” I was immediately impressed by the clarity and simplicity of Julia Franck’s language. Paradoxically, therein lies the challenge – how can I be faithful to the author's language? My approach to this problem was to flesh out the individual characters’ <em>modus operandi</em> – what drives them to do and say what they do – and in the process, I was able to somehow free myself from the original German text and commence with telling my ‘version’ of the story. Essentially, I feel this is a betrayal to the original text but a betrayal that is deeply necessary to the translation process.</p>
  <p>I would like to quote a translator whose work I greatly admire – Vera Kutzinski. She says: “…But there is, after all, a difference between a translation that succeeds, in some sense at least, because it is aware of its failure and one that fails because it is not.”</p>
