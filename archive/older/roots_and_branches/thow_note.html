         <h2>Thow Translator’s note</h2>
         <p>Amelia Rosselli (1930-1996) was born in Paris, in exile, to the famous Italian anti-fascist leader Carlo Rosselli, and an English political activist, Marion Cave. Carlo Rosselli and his brother Nello were gunned down by fascist assassins when Amelia was seven, which forced the Rosselli family further into exile. They fled first to England and then America, where Amelia spent part of her adolescence in upstate New York and Vermont. Amelia once said that these were some of the happiest times of her life. She settled in Rome in 1950, where she remained until her death; it was here that she began to write Italian verse. Because of her complicated personal trajectory, Amelia spoke Italian, English, and French fluently but retained a strange accent in each: her English sounded guttural and vaguely French, she had trouble rolling her Rs in Italian (a typical problem among English-speakers), and so on. <br />
           The sound of her voice, accented in every language (both as metaphor and in vibrant recordings), has been my best guide as I translate these poems. My main concern here is not to smooth her work over, but to try to honor it for its linguistic complexity, density, and peculiar musicality (Rosselli was also a composer and studied ethnomusicology). Additionally, visual poetics were important to Rosselli (as she defined it in her essay Spaci Metrici) and so I have made an attempt to reproduce the visual form of her poems in my English versions whenever possible. Her book of English poems, entitled Sleep, has been an invaluable guide for me in bringing her Italian poems into English. </p>
         <p><br />
           Branches, groves, and wooded areas in these poems (and elsewhere in her poetry) work as metaphors of mysterious (and even threatening) organic wholeness, natural images that Rosselli complicates with her hybridized language. The first two untitled poems (“I graft onto living” and “Stones outstretched in the woods…”) come from Rosselli’s third collection, Documento, poems written between 1966-1973. The last untitled poem, “Face in the grass you smell what little,” comes from her second collection, Serie Ospedaliera, written from 1963-1965.</p>
